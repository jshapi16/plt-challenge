Examining mouse cancer treatments with Matplotlib

In a study of 249 mice with squamous cell carcinmoa (SCC), or skin cancer, this analysis uses Matplotlib to identify which treatments were most effective at shrinking tumor size. 

The notebook shows the cleaning process - some mice had duplicate entries, as well as statistical analysis of the quartiles and interquartile range of the tumor shrinkage across the treatments.
